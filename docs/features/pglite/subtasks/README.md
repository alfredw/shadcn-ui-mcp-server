# Axios-Storage Integration Enhancement Subtasks

## Overview

This directory contains detailed subtasks for enhancing the existing axios-storage integration in the shadcn-ui-mcp-server. The integration between axios and the hybrid storage system is already functional, but these enhancements will improve performance, reliability, and user experience.

## Current State

✅ **Already Implemented**:
- Multi-tier hybrid storage (Memory → PGLite → GitHub)
- Storage integration layer (`storage-integration.ts`)
- All tools use `getCachedData()` for automatic caching
- Framework-aware axios implementations
- Circuit breaker protection
- Comprehensive error handling

## Enhancement Phases

### Phase 1: Performance Optimizations (1-2 days)
Focus on improving the existing integration with minimal changes.

#### [1.1 Request Deduplication](phase1-01-request-deduplication.md)
- **Goal**: Prevent duplicate concurrent API calls
- **Impact**: Reduce GitHub API usage by 20-30%
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Priority**: High

#### [1.2 Enhanced Statistics Collection](phase1-02-enhanced-statistics.md)
- **Goal**: Deeper insights into cache performance
- **Impact**: Better optimization decisions
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Priority**: Medium

#### [1.3 Batch Operation Optimization](phase1-03-batch-optimization.md)
- **Goal**: Improve performance for list operations
- **Impact**: 50%+ faster bulk operations
- **Effort**: 8-10 hours
- **Priority**: High

### Phase 2: Advanced Caching Features (2-3 days)
Add sophisticated caching capabilities while maintaining simplicity.

#### [2.1 Storage-Aware Axios Wrapper](phase2-01-storage-aware-axios.md)
- **Goal**: Deep integration of caching at HTTP client level
- **Impact**: Fine-grained cache control
- **Effort**: 8-10 hours
- **Priority**: Medium

#### [2.2 Smart Cache Invalidation](phase2-02-smart-cache-invalidation.md)
- **Goal**: Intelligent cache invalidation strategies
- **Impact**: Fresher data, reduced stale content
- **Effort**: 10-12 hours
- **Priority**: Medium

#### [2.3 Framework-Specific Optimizations](phase2-03-framework-optimizations.md)
- **Goal**: Tailored caching for React vs Svelte
- **Impact**: Better framework-specific performance
- **Effort**: 8-10 hours
- **Priority**: Low

### Phase 3: Production Features (2-3 days)
Essential features for production use by small teams.

#### [3.1 Simple Prefetching](phase3-01-simple-prefetching.md)
- **Goal**: Basic prefetching without ML complexity
- **Impact**: Improved perceived performance
- **Effort**: 4-6 hours
- **Priority**: Low

#### [3.2 Advanced Error Recovery](phase3-02-error-recovery.md)
- **Goal**: Robust handling of failures
- **Impact**: Better reliability and user experience
- **Effort**: 8-10 hours
- **Priority**: High

#### [3.3 Basic Performance Monitoring](phase3-03-basic-monitoring.md)
- **Goal**: Simple monitoring without external dependencies
- **Impact**: Visibility into system health
- **Effort**: 6-8 hours
- **Priority**: Medium

## Implementation Order

For maximum impact with minimal effort, implement in this order:

1. **Phase 1.1**: Request Deduplication (High impact, low effort)
2. **Phase 1.3**: Batch Optimization (High impact for common operations)
3. **Phase 3.2**: Error Recovery (Critical for reliability)
4. **Phase 1.2**: Enhanced Statistics (Foundation for optimization)
5. **Phase 3.3**: Basic Monitoring (Operational visibility)
6. **Phase 2.1**: Storage-Aware Axios (Advanced control)
7. **Phase 2.2**: Smart Invalidation (Data freshness)
8. **Phase 3.1**: Simple Prefetching (Nice-to-have)
9. **Phase 2.3**: Framework Optimizations (Nice-to-have)

## Quick Wins (< 1 day total)

If you only have limited time, implement these for maximum benefit:

1. **Request Deduplication** (4-6 hours) - Immediate API usage reduction
2. **Basic Monitoring Dashboard** (2-3 hours from Phase 3.3) - Visibility
3. **Simple Error Recovery** (3-4 hours from Phase 3.2) - Better reliability

## Testing Strategy

Each enhancement should include:
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests with existing system
- Performance benchmarks before/after
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Configuration

All enhancements should be configurable and default to current behavior:

```typescript
{
  "enhancements": {
    "requestDeduplication": true,
    "enhancedStatistics": true,
    "batchOptimization": {
      "enabled": true,
      "maxConcurrency": 5
    },
    "prefetching": {
      "enabled": false,
      "patterns": ["core"]
    },
    "monitoring": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dashboardPort": 3001
    }
  }
}
```

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to measure success:

1. **Cache Hit Rate**: Target >80% (currently ~70%)
2. **GitHub API Usage**: Reduce by 30-50%
3. **Response Times**: <100ms for cached, <500ms for uncached
4. **Error Rate**: <0.1% for storage operations
5. **System Uptime**: 99.9% availability

## Notes

- All enhancements are optional - the current system works well
- Focus on practical improvements for small team usage
- Avoid over-engineering - keep it simple and maintainable
- Each phase can be implemented independently
- Backward compatibility is mandatory
