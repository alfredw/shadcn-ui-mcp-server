   - Multi-tier caching strategy (L1: Memory, L2: PGLite, L3: GitHub)
   - Circuit breaker for API protection
   - Read/write strategies

5. **[Cache Management CLI](./05-cache-management-cli.md)** (2-3 days)
   - User-facing cache commands
   - Statistics display
   - Cache maintenance operations

6. **[Migration Utilities](./06-migration-utilities.md)** (3-4 days)
   - Migrate existing in-memory cache
   - Backward compatibility
   - Rollback capabilities

### Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
7. **[Statistics and Monitoring](./07-cache-statistics-monitoring.md)** (3-4 days)
   - Performance metrics collection
   - Analytics and dashboards
   - Alerting system

8. **[Configuration Management](./08-configuration-management.md)** (2-3 days)
   - Hierarchical configuration system
   - Runtime configuration updates
   - Profile support

### Integration & Quality (High Priority)
9. **[Comprehensive Test Suite](./09-comprehensive-test-suite.md)** (5-6 days)
   - Unit, integration, and E2E tests
   - Performance benchmarks
   - 90%+ code coverage target

10. **[Axios Integration](./10-axios-integration.md)** (3-4 days)
    - Update existing axios implementations
    - Request deduplication
    - Maintain backward compatibility

## Implementation Schedule

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- Tasks 1, 2, 3 can be developed in parallel by different developers
- Establish core infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Features (Week 2-3)
- Task 4 depends on Tasks 1-3
- Tasks 5 and 6 can proceed in parallel after Task 4

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Week 3-4)
- Tasks 7 and 8 can be developed independently
- Task 9 should start early and continue throughout

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 4)
- Task 10 integrates everything
- Final testing and documentation

## Total Estimated Effort
- **Development**: 30-38 days (with parallel work: ~4 weeks with 2-3 developers)
- **Testing & Documentation**: Additional 1 week
- **Total Timeline**: 5-6 weeks

## Key Dependencies
```
Task 1 (Interface) → Task 2, 3
Task 2 (Database) → Task 3, 6
Task 3 (PGLite Provider) → Task 4, 5, 7, 10
Task 4 (Hybrid Storage) → Task 5, 10
Task 8 (Config) → Task 4, 5, 10
Task 9 (Tests) → Continuous throughout
```

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: <5ms cache hits, <200ms cache misses
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, graceful degradation
- **Storage**: 100MB default limit, efficient eviction
- **User Experience**: Seamless migration, improved offline support

## Risk Mitigation
- **Rollback Plan**: Task 6 includes migration rollback
- **Feature Flags**: Task 8 enables gradual rollout
- **Monitoring**: Task 7 provides visibility
- **Testing**: Task 9 ensures quality

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve task breakdown
2. Assign developers to parallel tasks
3. Set up development branches
4. Begin with Tasks 1, 2, and 9 (testing framework)
